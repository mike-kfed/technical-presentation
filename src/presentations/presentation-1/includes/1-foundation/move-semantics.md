## Memory

- A computer program consists of a set of instructions.
- Those instructions manipulate some memory.
- How does a program know what memory can be used?

:::notes

- A program is not just the code that is running, it is also the current state
  of that program (the memory).
- But central here is the question: when does a program know when it can use a
  specific part of that memory, when is it available?

:::

## Program Execution

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

An executable **binary** (a file on your disk) will be loaded first into the memory.

::: incremental

- The **machine instructions** are loaded into the memory.

- The **static data** in the binary (i.e. strings etc)
  is also loaded into memory.

- The CPU starts fetching the instructions
  from the RAM and will start to execute the machine instructions.

- Two memory mechanisms are at play when executing:
  the **stack** and the **heap**

## Stack

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Continuous areas of memory for local variables
in functions.

::: incremental
  - It is fixed in size.

  - Stack grows and shrinks, it follows **function calls**.
    Each function has its own stack frame for all its local variables.

  - Values must have **fixed sizes known at compile time**.
    (If the compiler doesn't know it cannot compute the stack frame size)

  - Access is extremely fast: offset the **stack pointer**.

  - Great memory locality Ó™ú CPU caches.

## Stack - Example

```rust {data-line-numbers="|9-11|1-7|2-3|5-6||2,5|"}
fn foo() { // Enter 2. stack frame.
    let a: u32 = 10; // `a` points on the stack containing 10.
    println!("a address: {:p}", &a);

    let b: u32 = a;  // Copy `b` to `a`.
    println!("b address: {:p}", &b;
} // `a,b` out of scope, we leave the stack frame.

fn main() { // Enter 1. stack frame.
  foo()
}
```

Stack frame needs at least $2 \cdot 32$ bits = $2 \cdot 4$ bytes = $8$ bytes.

```text
a address: 0x7ffdb6f09c08
b address: 0x7ffdb6f09c0c  // 08 + 4bytes = 0c
```

:::notes

- First look at the execution flow of this program.
- We enter the `main` function which calls `foo`.
- We enter `foo`, the second stack frame.
- We create a local variable with value `10` and print its memory address.
- We create a local variable `b` by assigning `a` which copies the value from
  `a` to `b`, and we print its memory address.

- Lets look now from the compiler what it does.

- When the compiler compiles this program to machine instruction, it sees that
  function `foo` needs two 32bit variables, so the machine code in function
  `foo` will operate on a stack frame with exactly that size (namely 64 bits),
  to store `a` and `b` essentially for the instructions on line
- 2 and
- 5

# The Heap

The **heap** is just one **big pile of memory** for dynamic memory allocation.

::: {.fragment}

### Usage

:::incremental

- Memory which outlives the stack (when you leave the function).

- Storing **big objects** in memory is done using **the heap**.

:::

:::

---

# The Heap

The memory **management** on the **heap depends on the language** you write.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
::: {.fragment}

### Mechanics

:::incremental

- **Allocation/deallocation** on the heap is done by the operating system.
  - Linux: Programs will call into `glibc` (`malloc` , etc.) which interacts
    with the kernel.

- **Depends on the language**:

  :::::: {.columns}
  ::: {.column width="50%"}
  - [**Full Control**]{.red}: C, C++, Pascal,...:
    - Programmer decides when to allocate and deallocate memory.
    - Programmer ensures if some pointer still points to valid memory Ó™ú üöÄ vs. üí£üêû

  :::
  ::: {.column width="50%"}
  - [**Full Safety**]{.green}: Java, Python, Go, Haskell, ...:
    - A runtime system (**garbage collector**) ensures memory is deallocated at
      the right time. Ó™ú üêå vs. ü¶∫

### Mechanics - Rust

- [**Full Control and Safety**]{.green}: **Rust** ü¶Ä - [Via compile
  time enforcement of correct memory management.]{.emph}

  - It does this with an explicit ownership concept.
  - It tracks life times (of references).

# Variable Scoping (recap)

```rust
fn main() {
    let i = 10; // `i` in scope.

    if i > 5 {
        let j = i;
    }  // `j` no longer in scope.

    println!("i = {}", i);
} // i is no longer in scope
```

- Types of `i` and `j` are examples of a `Copy` types.
- What if copying is too expensive?

::: notes

- When looking at how Rust solves working with the heap, we have to know a
  little bit about variable scoping.
- In Rust, every variable has a scope, that is, a section of the code that that
  variable is valid for. Note that this is a bit different from python.
- In our example we have `i` and `j`. Note how we can just create a copy by
  assigning `i` to `j`.
- Here the type of i and j is actually known as a `Copy` type.
- But sometimes there is data that would be way too much to Copy around every
  time, it would make our program slow.

## Ownership

:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
println!("{}", x);
```

Some local variables allocated on the stack.

![](${meta:include-base-dir}/assets/images/A1-string-stack.svg)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```rust
// Create an owned, heap allocated string
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

Strings store their data on the heap because they can grow

::: notes

- Let's take the previous example and get rid of some scopes, instead we are
  just going to assign x to y, and then print both x and y. What do we think is
  going to happen?
- Now the same example again, but now with a String, "hello", we are just going
  to assign it to another variable and then print both s1 and s2. What do we
  think is going to happen now?
- See how this time the compiler doesn't even let us run the program. Hold on,
  what's going on here?
- Actually, in Rust strings can grow, that means that we can no longer store
  them on the stack, and we can no longer just copy them around by re-assigning
  them somewhere else.
