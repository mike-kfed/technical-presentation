Hello everyone, and a warm welcome to this Rust workshop! I'm thrilled to see
that Rust has sparked such interest within our team, and that you're eager to
dive into this language. Iâ€™ve designed the first part of this presentation with
a focus on the Python ecosystem, since Python is widely used here at SDSC and is
likely your go-to language.

My goal is that by the end of this workshop, you'll not only have a new
perspective on Python but also develop a genuine appreciation for Rust. I've put
together a self-contained learning course with now 200 slides and about 10
exercises for the core concepts to build a strong foundation. While it might
seem like a lot, I believe it's important to thoroughly understand the core
concepts rather than just picking them up on the fly, which can be more
challengingâ€”especially if you're primarily experienced with Python, where many
computer-science related things are hidden under the hood.

We'll start with the basics and gradually move on to more advanced topics. Where
we finish will depend on your interests, and I can tell you now, we definitely
won't wrap up in just two days!

A disclaimer before we start: I hope and expect that your perspective on Python
will shift towards the negative end =). There is to say that Rust is not a
silver-bullet. Its a complicated language with a steep learning curve and also
has its quirks and dark spots. We can abbreviate Python more or less like
"Run-Time Mess" and Rust with "Compile-Time Mess".

Rusts mascot by the way is called Ferris the Crab because some Rust developers
call themself Rustoceans. I let AI generate Ferris with super powers, thats what
it spit out =)

Without further ado, lets dive in.
